Bumbling around trying to create a system tray keyboard layout helper

Progress so far:

Important things missing:

- Toggle button. Currently it's just always on and can get in the way
- Layout selection. Currently just need to edit default-layout.json


ToDos:

- Important things
- Probably a million nice-to-haves
